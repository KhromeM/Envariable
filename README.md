## Who we are
Work or Pay lets you write concrete goals and a deadline to complete it, then allows you to deposit money that we hold until the deadline passes. We act as a middleman to decide whether you achieved the goal or not 
1) Form a Contract

 - Our contracts provide external motivation, keeping you on track to meet your goals.

2) Choose a Goal

  - Want to be more productive? Exercise daily? Launch your business?

3) Set a Deadline

 - Choose a deadline as short as a day or as long as a month.

4) Set the Stakes

- Put some stakes on it! Choose a financial or social penalty!

5) Daily Check Ups

- We check up on you every day to keep you on track.

6) Verification

- When you report you have achieved your goal, we verify your claim.
